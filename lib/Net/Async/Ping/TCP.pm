=head1 NAME

Net::Async::Ping::TCP

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the TCP part of L<Net::Async::Ping>. See that documentation for full details.

=head2 Return value

L<Net::Async::Ping::TCP> will always terminate with the hi resolution time it
took to check for liveness, with the success or failure checked by
introspecting the future itself.

=head2 Additional options

C<service_check>, which is off by default, will cause ping to fail if the host refuses
connection to the selected port (7 by default.)

 my $p = Net::Async::Ping->new(
   tcp => {
      service_check => 1,
   },
 );
