=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module's goal is to eventually be able to test remote hosts
on a network with a number of different socket types and protocols.
Currently it only supports TCP and ICMP, but UDP, and Syn are planned.
If you need one of those feel free to work up a patch.

This module was originally forked off of L<Net::Ping>, so it shares B<some> of it's interface, but only where it makes sense.

=method new

 my $p = Net::Async::Ping->new(
   $proto, $def_timeout, $bytes, $device, $tos, $ttl,
 );

All arguments to new are optional, but if you want to provide one in the
middle you must provide all the ones to the left of it.  The default
protocol is C<tcp>.  The default timeout is 5 seconds.
C<device> is what host to bind the socket to, ie what to ping B<from>.
C<bytes>, C<tos> and C<ttl> do not currently apply.

Alternately, you can use a new constructor:

 my $p = Net::Async::Ping->new(
   tcp => {
      default_timeout => 10,
      bind            => '192.168.1.1',
      port_number     => 80,
   },
 );

All of the above arguments are optional. Bind is the same as device from
before.

See L<Net::Async::Ping::TCP> and L<Net::Async::Ping::ICMP> for module specific
options.

=method ping

 my $future = $p->ping($loop, $host, $timeout);

Returns a L<Future> representing the ping.  C<loop> should be an
L<IO::Async::Loop>, host is the host, and timeout is optional and defaults to
the default set above.

It's also possible to omit the $loop, and add the pinger to a loop afterwards:

 my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new;
 $p->ping($host);
 $loop->add( $p );

The return value of the future depends on the protocol. See
L<Net::Async::Ping::TCP> and L<Net::Async::Ping::ICMP>.
